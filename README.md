<!-- Tip: When you're ready to deploy the application to other computers, you can create a requirements.txt file with the command pip freeze > requirements.txt (pip3 on macOS/Linux). The requirements file describes the packages you've installed in your virtual environment. With only this file, you or other developers can restore those packages using pip install -r requirements.txt (or, again, pip3 on macOS/Linux). By using a requirements file, you need not commit the virtual environment itself to source control. -->
